                Mariah Carey is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress and entrepreneur. 
                 Referred to as the "Songbird Supreme" by the Guinness World Records, she is noted for 
                 her five-octave vocal range, signature use of the whistle register, 
                 and songwriting prowess. 
                She was born on March 27, 1969 in Huntington, New York.  Her father, 
                Alfred Roy Carey, was of African American and Afro-Venezuelan descent, while her 
                mother, Patricia (n√©e Hickey), is of Irish American descent. According to Mariah, 
                her maternal grandparents were "from Ireland".                                 
                Mariah Carey rose to fame in 1990 after signing to Columbia Records and releasing her eponymous 
                debut album.  Soon after, Carey became the only artist ever to have their first five singles 
                reach number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, from "Vision of Love" to "Emotions".
                Carey achieved worldwide success with follow-up R&B and pop albums Music Box (1993), Merry Christmas (1994), 
                and Daydream (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including "Hero", 
                "Without You", "All I Want for Christmas Is You", "Fantasy", "Always Be My Baby", as well as "One Sweet Day", 
                which later became Billboard's Song Of The Decade (1990s).
                Throughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her 
                one of the best-selling music artists of all time. With a total of 19 songs topping the Billboard 
                Hot 100, she holds the record for the most number-one singles by a solo artist, a female songwriter, and a female producer.
                Carey began dating Tommy Mottola, a record producer while recording Music Box, and married him on June 5, 1993. 
                After the release of Daydream and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time. 
                Carey's relationship with Mottola began to deteriorate, due to their growing creative differences in terms of her albums, 
                as well as his controlling nature.  On May 30, 1997, the couple announced their separation, 
                with their divorce finalized by the time Mottola remarried on December 2, 2000.  
                Carey met actor and comedian Nick Cannon while they shot her music video for her song "Bye Bye" on an 
                island off the coast of Antigua.  On April 30, 2008, Carey married Cannon in The Bahamas. She gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, 
                on April 30, 2011.  Monroe is named after Marilyn Monroe; Moroccan is named after the Moroccan-decor room in Carey's apartment where Cannon proposed to her.  
                In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated.  He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014.  It was finalized in 2016.
